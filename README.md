# Personal-projects

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Personal Projects repository! This repository is a collection of various hands-on cybersecurity projects and simulations Iâ€™ve worked on to enhance my skills in ethical hacking, network security, and post-exploitation techniques. Each project aims to demonstrate a different aspect of cybersecurity, including vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, exploitation, and defense mechanisms.

You can view all of my current completed projects under the Projects Tab 


## Appendix

To replicate any of these projects, you will need:

A Kali Linux environment, either installed natively or on a virtual machine (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware).
A Windows VM (for Koadic projects) or other target VMs depending on the project scope.
Internet access for downloading tools (e.g., Nmap, Nessus, Aircrack-ng, SQLmap).
Some projects may require root privileges or administrative access.
Each project folder contains its own:

Instructions: Step-by-step guide to set up and execute the simulation.
Source Code (if applicable): Custom scripts or code used during the project.
Documentation: In-depth details on the process, results, and analysis.
Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Linux, Windows, and virtual environments.
Familiarity with cybersecurity concepts such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation techniques.
